h1. Pongan : display

This project is one of the three projects made for the Global Google Tv Hackathon London
The overall idea of the project is a modern version of Loren Carpenterâ€™s crowd experiment

Display is the game itself, it is receiving the event for the movement of the paddle from a channel open to a google appengine instance.

Parts of the project are :

- android controller for mobiles

https://github.com/luigi-agosti/pongan-controller

- google tv display for the pong game

https://github.com/luigi-agosti/pongan-display

- google appengine to manage communication with channel api

https://github.com/dreab8/pongan-server

Please remember that the code is done during an hackathon and as such shouldn't be use for any business scenario
